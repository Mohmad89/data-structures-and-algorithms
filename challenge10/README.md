# Stacks and Queues
* Stacks : is a data structrue that allow to us add value and then delete it from the last (FILO)  
* Queues : is a data structrue that allow to us add value and then delete it from the first (FIFO)
## Challenge
we want to create Stack class that has  methods such as (push : to add value , pop : to delete value, peek : to show what is the top iside the stack)  
and create queue cllass that too has methods such as (enqueue: to add value, dequeue: to delete value from the front, peek : to show us the front value )  
and then we want to add some test mehtod to test our app.

## API
### 1) Stack Mehtods  
* push : to add value   
*  pop : to delete value   
*  peek : to show what is the top iside the stack
* isEmpty : to check if stack is empty or not and return boolean value
### 2) Queue Mehods
* enqueue: to add value    
* dequeue: to delete value from the front   
* peek : to show us the front value
* isEmpty : to check if queue is empty or not and return boolean value
